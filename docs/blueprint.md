## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) that conveys trustworthiness and a sense of modernity, drawn from the dominant color of the school's graduation cap logo.
- Background color: Light teal (#E0FFFF) -- this is a desaturated, brightened version of the primary, which will provide a soft, spacious feel to the UI.
- Accent color: Mustard (#E1AD01) drawn from the logo's tassel, it will direct attention and offer playful contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern and minimalistic look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Minimal, outlined icons (Lucide or Material Icons) to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Clean, card-based UI with a responsive grid system to ensure usability across devices.
- Smooth, soothing animations for page loads and form submissions, with subtle transitions to enhance user experience and cater to younger users.
